## Next 10 Buses

Will be a repository for my 'Next 10 Buses' project.

The objective of this project is to create a web app in React.js that will show you the next ten buses that are due to arrive at any bus stops near your current location (UK only).  The app will use as defaults your current location and any bus stop within 1km of your current location.  

It will be possible to update the location, distance and select how the results are presented (list view or map view) before performing a search.

Search results will be available in list view and map view.

When selecting a journey from the list view it will be possible to see the subsequent stops on the journey or see that specific journey only on a map view.

A full suite of test scripts using Jest and Testing-React will be produced to verify the apps functionality.


At the time of writing I have just started this so there isn't much to see, but I will commit the source code and udpate this readme as I progress.
